### Callout Boxes
Use these for important information:

> **üí° Key Insight**
> This is an important concept that readers should remember.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**
> This is something that could cause problems if not handled correctly.

> **‚úÖ Best Practice**
> This is a recommended approach or technique.

### Code Examples
Always include comments and explanations:

```python
# Clear, descriptive function name
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time):
    """
    Calculate compound interest using the standard formula.

    Args:
        principal: Initial amount invested
        rate: Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
        time: Number of years

    Returns:
        Final amount after compound interest
    """
    return principal * (1 + rate) ** time

# Example usage with explanation
initial_investment = 1000
annual_rate = 0.05  # 5% annual rate
years = 10

final_amount = calculate_compound_interest(initial_investment, annual_rate, years)
print(f"${initial_investment} invested at {annual_rate*100}% for {years} years = ${final_amount:.2f}")
```

### Visual Elements
Use tables for comparisons:

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| Method A | Pro 1, Pro 2 | Con 1, Con 2 | Use case A |
| Method B | Pro 1, Pro 2 | Con 1, Con 2 | Use case B |

## Writing Guidelines

### Voice and Tone
- **Authoritative but approachable**: You're the expert, but make it accessible
- **Comprehensive but clear**: Cover topics thoroughly without unnecessary complexity
- **Practical focus**: Always explain why concepts matter in real-world applications

### Content Depth
- **Minimum 3,000 words** for substantive topics
- **Multiple examples** for complex concepts
- **Step-by-step explanations** for processes
- **Context and background** for better understanding

### Anti-Brain-Rot Principles
- **No shortcuts or quick fixes** - focus on deep understanding
- **Encourage slow, thoughtful reading** - use clear structure and pacing
- **Provide comprehensive coverage** - don't leave important gaps
- **Connect concepts** - show how topics relate to the bigger picture
