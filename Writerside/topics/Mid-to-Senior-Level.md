## Common Senior Engineer Challenges

### The Promotion Trap
**Challenge**: Being promoted to senior but continuing to work as a mid-level engineer
**Solution**:
- Deliberately seek opportunities for leadership and influence
- Focus on team and organizational impact, not just individual contributions
- Practice saying "no" to low-impact work to make room for high-impact activities

### Impostor Syndrome at Scale
**Challenge**: Feeling unprepared for the increased responsibility and visibility
**Solution**:
- Recognize that senior engineers are expected to learn and adapt continuously
- Build a network of senior peers for advice and support
- Focus on the value you provide rather than what you don't know
- Celebrate wins and learn from failures without personal judgment

### Balancing Individual Work and Leadership
**Challenge**: Finding time for both hands-on technical work and leadership responsibilities
**Solution**:
- Be selective about the technical work you take on directly
- Focus on high-impact, strategic technical projects
